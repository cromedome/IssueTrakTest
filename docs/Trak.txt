    bin/trak.pl - Run the IssueTrak formula parser

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
        ./bin/trak.pl [--debug] [--help] [--formulahelp] [formula1] [formula2]

        # If you like shorter arguments...
        ./bin/trak.pl [-d] [-h] [-f] [formula1] [formula2]

[1mOPTIONS[0m
    debug
        Turn on debugging. This adds a lot of information to the display when
        the forumla parser is running.

    formulahelp
        Get help from the calculator itself. This shows a list of available
        operators and functions.

    help
        Show this help information.

    formula[1, 2, ...]
        One or more formulas, wrapped in quotations. One formula per
        quotation.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    This program tries to parse any formulas passed through the command line
    directly. If no formulas were given, launch an interactive shell that lets
    the user enter a formula and execute it immediately.

    The calculator is implemented by Trak. See the documentation there for
    specifics on how it is implemented.

[1mUSING THE SHELL[0m
    When started with no formula arguments, trak.pl starts an interactive
    shell. From this shell, you can enter a single formula from the prompt,
    and the calculator will evaluate it and give you back an answer.

    The shell has several additional commands available:

    debug
        Toggle debugging mode. When in debugging mode, you will get trace
        output showing how the calculator arrived at a result.

    exit
        Exit the interactive shell.

    help
        Get a list of available operators and functions from the calculator.
        Equivalent to the "--formulahelp" command line argument.
