t/calc.t ........ 
ok 1 - Calculator can evaluate simple formulas
ok 2 - ...and complex ones too
ok 3 - Calculator does basic addition
ok 4 - ...and subtraction
ok 5 - ...and multiplication
ok 6 - ...and division
ok 7 - ...but doesn't let us divide by zero
ok 8 - ...we can do modulus too
ok 9 - ...but again, not by zero
ok 10 - ...and can handle exponentiation
ok 11 - ...even several strung together
ok 12 - ...as well as implicit multiplication
ok 13 - ...in a couple of different fashions
ok 14 - Calculator calculates square root
ok 15 - ...and sine
ok 16 - ...and cosine
ok 17 - ...and tangent
ok 18 - Calculator only works correctly with integers
ok 19 - ...and complains when operands are not
ok 20 - ...it handles negative numbers properly
ok 21 - ...and weird combinations of whitespace too
ok 22 - Calculator correctly evaluates parenthesis
ok 23 - ...and complains when the closing paren is missing
ok 24 - ...and thinks an unmatched ) is rightfully a problem
ok 25 - Calculator won't try to evaluate functions it doesn't know about
ok 26 - ...and will complain when given invalid characters
ok 27 - ...and will fail when given an invalid formula
ok 28 - ...and will fail when given too few operands
ok 29 - ...when we enable debugging for calculator
ok 30 - ...we get trace information on STDERR
ok 31 - Calculator produces formula help when asked
